# frontenedpages Status

## Repository

The working repository is `frontenedpages`, initialized from the available SKYCOIN4444 project source and published privately at [github.com/skylerblue333/frontenedpages](https://github.com/skylerblue333/frontenedpages). The local branch is `main`, and the initial source snapshot is committed locally and pushed to `origin/main`.

## Imported frontend state

The project preserves the existing React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, Wouter, tRPC, and Express structure. It was not rebuilt from scratch. The Approval Workflows route is registered at `/approval-workflows` and presents a truthful unavailable state: it does not create requests, assign approvers, record decisions, send notifications, or claim workflow completion when those services are not connected.

## Validation findings

The current compiler is TypeScript 7, which rejects the removed `baseUrl` compiler option. The option was removed while retaining the existing `@/*` and `@shared/*` path aliases. The frontend also lacked the declared `@radix-ui/react-icons` dependency required by `WalkthroughPage.tsx`; that dependency was added to `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

The full build remains blocked by pre-existing missing source imports, including `client/src/core/actions/actionTypes`, `client/src/hooks/useAuth`, `client/src/components/ui/sk`, `client/src/components/StatCard`, and `client/src/hooks/useFileUpload`. These are not represented as resolved or functional. The Vite preview was therefore not treated as a successful visual verification for the imported baseline.

## Next safe work

Continue by reconciling the missing source modules against the intended SKYCOIN4444 checkout before repairing them. Do not fabricate authentication, API, file-upload, governance, financial, or other backend behavior merely to satisfy the build.


## Chain Explorer hardening

The registered route `/chain-explorer` no longer renders a generic coming-soon placeholder. It now explicitly reports that blockchain exploration is unavailable and does not fabricate chain IDs, network health, block heights, addresses, transactions, balances, fees, confirmations, finality, or indexing status. The screen documents the required RPC/indexer, allowlist, reorganization, freshness, rate-limit, validation, and independent-verification boundaries. Focused TypeScript validation reported no diagnostics for `ChainExplorer.tsx`, and `git diff --check` passed. The full repository build remains blocked by pre-existing unresolved imports documented above.


## Blockchain Custody hardening

The registered custody surface was audited at `/blockchain-custody`. The previous implementation claimed non-custodial HD wallet derivation, multi-chain balances, gas estimation, transaction signing, broadcast, and confirmation tracking while the imported server routes `blockchain` through the generic `createFeatureRouter()` and do not expose verified custody procedures. The page now disables custody actions and reports no wallet, key, balance, signature, gas, transaction, broadcast, or settlement result. It explicitly warns users never to enter a seed phrase or private key into this deployment. Focused TypeScript validation reported no diagnostics for `BlockchainCustody.tsx`, and `git diff --check` passed.


## Checkout Flow hardening

The registered route `/checkout-flow` no longer renders a generic coming-soon placeholder. It now reports that checkout is unavailable and does not calculate payable totals, collect or authorize payment details, reserve inventory, create orders, issue receipts, or claim fulfillment. It documents server-side pricing, tax and shipping rules, idempotent order creation, refund handling, and fulfillment requirements. Focused TypeScript validation reported no diagnostics for `CheckoutFlow.tsx`, and `git diff --check` passed.


## Crypto Wallet hardening

The registered route `/crypto` no longer renders hardcoded token prices, percentage changes, balances, portfolio value, transaction history, APY, TVL, or unsupported swap/send/receive/yield/insurance actions. The previous page also referenced an undefined `isAuthenticated` value and untyped transaction data. It now presents a truthful crypto integration boundary with no wallet, market-data, portfolio, or transaction claims and explicitly warns users not to enter seed phrases or private keys. Focused TypeScript validation reported no diagnostics for `Crypto.tsx`, and `git diff --check` passed. Mentions of APY and TVL are now requirements/absence statements only, not values or product claims.
