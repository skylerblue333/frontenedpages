# frontenedpages Status

## Repository

The working repository is `frontenedpages`, initialized from the available SKYCOIN4444 project source and published privately at [github.com/skylerblue333/frontenedpages](https://github.com/skylerblue333/frontenedpages). The local branch is `main`, and the initial source snapshot is committed locally and pushed to `origin/main`.

## Imported frontend state

The project preserves the existing React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, Wouter, tRPC, and Express structure. It was not rebuilt from scratch. The Approval Workflows route is registered at `/approval-workflows` and presents a truthful unavailable state: it does not create requests, assign approvers, record decisions, send notifications, or claim workflow completion when those services are not connected.

## Validation findings

The current compiler is TypeScript 7, which rejects the removed `baseUrl` compiler option. The option was removed while retaining the existing `@/*` and `@shared/*` path aliases. The frontend also lacked the declared `@radix-ui/react-icons` dependency required by `WalkthroughPage.tsx`; that dependency was added to `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

The full build remains blocked by pre-existing missing source imports, including `client/src/core/actions/actionTypes`, `client/src/hooks/useAuth`, `client/src/components/ui/sk`, `client/src/components/StatCard`, and `client/src/hooks/useFileUpload`. These are not represented as resolved or functional. The Vite preview was therefore not treated as a successful visual verification for the imported baseline.

## Next safe work

Continue by reconciling the missing source modules against the intended SKYCOIN4444 checkout before repairing them. Do not fabricate authentication, API, file-upload, governance, financial, or other backend behavior merely to satisfy the build.
